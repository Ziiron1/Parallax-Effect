        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>The parallax effect is based on an optical illusion, as it gives the impression to the human eye that objects
            or
            people are moving, closer or further away. Thus, this webdesign feature causes the feeling of
            that distant images move slower than objects that are close.

            <br>
            <br>

            This effect has been used for some time in different digital media, giving a
            quite real effect. The use of this resource began in traditional animation, and has also been used in
            Hollywood film productions, such as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as well as
            video games.

            <br>
            <br>

            Over the years, and with technological advances, parallax effects have been perfected and gained popularity.
            preference of webdesigners around the world, being used on websites, blogs and various social networks.
